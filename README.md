## Task description
The task to solve was to develop an application, API or a design that makes it possible to perform a KYC check 
on individuals and/or persons in within an organization. 

KYC or "know your customer" are tools that ensure that a financial company knows enough about its customers to 
prevent and detect whether the financial system is being used for illegal activities, such as money laundering, 
corruption and terrorist financing. One of these measures is to carry out a PEP (Politically Exposed Person) check 
on customers. A politically exposed person generally has a greater risk of corruption and bribery associated with him, 
and will thus be flagged for manual processing in, for example, a loan application at a bank. 

More about the task description can be found [here](https://github.com/stacc/stacc-code-challenge-public).

## Project description
In my solution, I chose to prioritize a backend solution, and created an API according to the task suggestions. 
The project is coded in Java and is using the Springboot framework to make it a REST-API. I focused on making two endpoints, 
one for performing a PEP check on an individual, and one for checking all persons in an organization. Both endpoints are using 
the provided CSV file [pep.csv](src/main/resources/pep.csv) with publicly exposed persons, to decide if a given name is publicly exposed or not.
The second endpoint is using the [provided API](https://code-challenge.stacc.dev/) from Stacc to search up an organization by an organization number to get 
people involved in that organization and then compare that to the list of publicly exposed persons.

## Setup
1. To run this project, you will need to install Java version 17.
2. Clone the project from the [GitHub](https://github.com/EspenKalvatn/Stacc-KYC-API.git) using either `SSH` or `HTTPS`.
Alternatively you can download the source code with the button to the left of the clone button and unzip the source code at the desired location.
3. Inside the IDE of your choice, open the project by
    - IntelliJ: navigate `File -> New -> Project from Version Control` and paste the link provided by step 2 (either with `SSH` or `HTTPS`).
    - Eclipse: navigate `File -> Import -> Git -> Clone URI` and paste the link provided by step 2 (either with `SSH` or `HTTPS`).
    - Other IDEs have similar ways to import projects from version control systems.
    - If you are downloading the source code directly. Open the project by `File -> New -> Project from Existing Source...` (IntelliJ). Eclipse have similar procedure.

## How to run
Inside the IDE of your choice, locate the main class `src/main/java/Stacc/KYC/API/StaccKycApiApplication.java` and run it.
The API is now running locally on your computer. 

## How to use
The API has two endpoints. To use the endpoints, you can for example use Postman, or simply open up a web browser and write 
the API call in the search bar. Since the API is running locally, you will need to use `localhost:8080/check`

### Check person
`/person/{name}` takes in a name or alias (text string) and performs a PEP-check on this name towards the list provided.
The call returns a sentence which tells you if the name is of a publicly exposed person or not. This could easily be replaced with a boolean if wanted.
#### Input:
    localhost:8080/check/person/Erna Solberg
#### Output:
    Erna Solberg is a politically exposed person.

### Check organization
`/organization/{organization number}` takes in an organization number (text string), performs a PEP-check on people inside 
that organization and returns a list of names (text strings) of publicly exposed persons within the organization.
#### Input:
    localhost:8080/check/organization/870168012
#### Output: 
    ["Erna Solberg","Jan Tore Sanner","Helge Orten","Trond Helleland","Kristin Ã˜rmen Johnsen","Tina Bru","Heidi Nordby Lunde","Lars Myraune"]

## Further remarks
First, I misread the task description and based the API solution on the data from the perp_small.json file. This dataset was quite small compared to the pep.csv file.
I found working with JSON data in Java much easier than working with CSV files and found very easy solutions to convert JSON objects to POJO (plain old java objects). 
After switching to working with the pep.csv instead, I made some methods to create a similar solutions as with the JSON objects. I ended up with two solutions, the first 
where I only store the names and the aliases from the CSV file, and the second where I create a Person-object for each row in the dataset. For this solution, I found it sufficient
to use the first solution and just store the names and aliases from the file, but for a more general solution, I went with the second one. I can see that it may be of interest to 
return a JSON object with information if the person you are checking is politically exposed.
